## Background
This project was started to help Microsoft customers deploy Shared Calling for Microsoft Teams Phone. The project consists of interactive powershell scripts that guide IT admins through the process of setting up Shared Calling features for Microsoft Teams Phone. Here you can find the source code, documentation, and instructions on how to use the scripts. It is recommended that you download the latest release of the project directly from this GitHub repository. Find the latest release [here](https://github.com/robwatts365/MicrosoftTeamsPhone-ConfigureSharedCalling/releases).

The project aims to make it easier and faster for IT admins to configure and deploy shared calling for Microsoft Teams Phone, which is a feature that allows multiple users to share a phone number and make or receive calls on behalf of a group or a department. The scripts automate the steps required to create and assign shared calling policies, create and configure resource accounts, assign phone numbers and licenses, and enable or disable shared calling for users.

The project is open source and welcomes contributions from the community.
